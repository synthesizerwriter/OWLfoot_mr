***Adding a footswitch input to the OWL Pedal***

Ths project is a '*technology enabler*': a piece of hardware that is then used in several software projects (which will also be documented here on the 'synthesizerwriter' github...). 

*The OWL Pedal*

The OWL pedal from Rebel Technology is a guitar stomp box with a difference - you can program the micro controller inside it to run any of over 200 'patches', ranging from the delays and flanging that you would expect, to sound generators and step sequencers.

The OWL pedal has stereo input and output jacks, as well as another quarter inch jack for an expression pedal, and this can be used to control many of the patches. There is also a small push-button on the top of the pedal that can be used to change patches, or as an extra input for things like tap tempo (particularly useful for sequencer patches, or for setting delay time). So far, pretty near a perfect solution for anyone who wants a programmable pedal.
